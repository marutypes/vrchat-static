## [1.0.2] - 2023-06-20

### Fixes
- Fix traps not being upgrade/sellable after the change in 1.0.1

## [1.0.1] - 2023-06-19

### Quality of Life Changes
-  Selling, Upgrading, and Heal pickups can no longer effect something you can't see. This should make it harder to accidentally upgrade or sell something by dropping the object while looking away.

### Fixes

- Bats should no longer take divergent paths or get stuck in the wall in waves 20-30
